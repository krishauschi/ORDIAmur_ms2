## Shoot and root fresh mass (FM)
To assess the growth reduction of apple grown in replant disease-affected (ARD) soils, plants were grown in ARD and respective y-irradiated (yARD) soils for 56 days. At the end of the growing period, shoot and root FM were recorded and evaluated based on the three following factors:
- Treatment: ARD, yARD
- Soil: HG, HO, EH, PI, RU, Me
- Gentype: M.26, MAl0130, MAL0739, EMR.2, G.202, G.935
