## Microbiome analysis
Analysis of the root-affected soil microbiome, 16S rRNA gene (bacteria) and ITS (fungi) datasets were processed and analyzed independently. Raw amplicon sequences were processed and classified using DADA2 version 1.12.1 (Callahan et al. 2016). Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were taxonomically classified using the SILVA database version 138 (Quast et al. 2013) for the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence dataset, and the UNITE general FASTA release for Fungi 2 version 9.0 (Abarenkov et al. 2023) for the ITS amplicon sequence dataset.

The root-affected soil microbiome was analyzed exclusive for ARD soil, but not for yARD for the following two factors: 
- Soil: HG, EH, RU
- Genotype: M.26, MAL0130, MAl0739
